# Habit-Tracker

Habit-Tracker is an interactive and fully fuctional habit tracker made using Tkinter and the Pixela API. The program uses HTTP post requests using the requests module to to access the Pixela API and modify/configure the graph in real time. The interactive GUI is made using Tkinter. The Tkcalendar widget is used to create a functional and interactive calendar where the user can simply choose the date and track their habit data. 

In order to use this tracker, you will need to create your own graph through Pixela, and then simply input your token where it requires you to in the main.py script. You will also need to change all the graph links to your own. After that, simply run the script and use the habit tracker! Please contact me if you have any questions about the code or need help setting up the script correctly.
